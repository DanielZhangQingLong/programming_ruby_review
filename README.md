# Review ruby read and practice " Programming Ruby"(Pickaxe)"
## Concontrating on a little bit more advanced skills


> Among the last month, I have developped some very small apps such as 'game review', 'recipe box' and 'todo'. They are all very basic but I learnt a lot by making them.

> However I found that my ruby programming skill need to be improved a lot. I am not satisfied with it. I must do something kicking ass with ruby. So I am picking up the book called 'Programming Ruby' which I read several months ago.

> This time I will start from chapter #1. I will pay more attention to the knowledges of Blocks, Closures ect. At the same time, I will review the basic programma in ruby.

### Emphasis stuff

* Classes, Object, Variables
* Containers, Blocks, Iterators
* Modules, Mixins

### Strengthen stuff

* Threads, Firbers, Processes
* Blocks, Closures, Proc Object
* Duck Typing
* Metaprogramming


> I believe in myself that I will be a good programmer.
